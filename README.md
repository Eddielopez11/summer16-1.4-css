## Requirements
1. Fork the class assignment
1. Clone the now forked version to your machine
1. Reference this [full design comp](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/mu5r2dhl8yk2n7i/powell_peralta.jpg?dl=0)
1. `link` in a css file (call it `main.css`) in the `head` of your `index.html`
1. Add `classes` to the elements inside of `index.html` in order to select them
1. Make sure that every element you're styling is selected through classes and not through _element_ selectors
1. Organize sections of your CSS code with comments to add further context for each group of selectors
1. Do not use class selectors more than 3 levels deep (a problem if seen: `.className .className .className`)

## Normal Mode
- Push up your most recent code to Github
- Submit a link to your repository of code on TIYO

## Adventurer Mode
- Customize the content & style of the site you've created to be the beginnings of your portfolio!
  - The articles of content will eventually include: projects that you will complete, written blog posts, photos of professional interests, etc...
  - Customize all colors used (try [flat ui colors](https://flatuicolors.com/))
  - Customize all button verbs
  - No content or code should reference "sk8", "skateboards", etc... and should all be updated to reference yourself
